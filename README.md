## Description
This is a simple text editor. When you first arrive, You are greeted by the header. You can get rid of it if you'd like and start typing. The way to save your work is to click on anything that isn't the text editor. Whatever you save will be waiting for you until you get back and change it.
I built this app it to practice working and deploying with Webpack. Also, This app can be installed which is cool to know how to do.
